Dagger 2 Sample
===

This is a simple Dagger 2 example that shows two things.
1. Components with @ActivityScope.
2. Components with @UserScope.

So there are three levels where you can define stuff to inject.
First on the Application level or @Singleton.
Then within the scope of a user's session.
And below that on an activity scope.
